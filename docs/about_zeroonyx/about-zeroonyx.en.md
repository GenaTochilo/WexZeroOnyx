# About ZeroOnyx Community and Server

---

### Hub Principle
The server is created as a hub, meaning a gathering place and a comfortable environment for playing Space Station 13.
The number of active players, unique mechanics, or community expansion are **not** a priority.

---

### The community exists to play the game
Conflict, provocativeness, controversial topics, power races, and political discussions (both real world politics and the internal politics of the ZeroOnyx community and SS13 as a whole) may be curtailed in favor of a comfortable environment for all participants.

---

### Collaboration
The direction of the server is determined by the community, but moderated by the administration team.  
ZeroOnyx prioritizes collaboration between regular community members and those with elevated access (lead, admins, cotributors).

The majority (players) share their views, and the project team invests free time and effort to realize these views, as long as they with the server's purpose.  
The same is true in the opposite direction, the team shares their free time, and the players try to assist the team in keeping the community interesting and comfortable for everyone.

---

### Two languages
ZeroOnyx supports both English and Russian languages. This includes communication on Discord, the game server, and in-character interactions.

From an in-game perspective, these languages are considered subtypes of Galactic Common and share the same properties as their real-world counterparts. This means characters may not understand one of these languages depending on their individual skills and player preferences.

For GitHub contributions such as pull requests (PRs), issues, and discussion comments, Russian may be used, but English is preferred to keep the code and documentation accessible to those who do not speak Russian.  
This is particularly important as the development of Space Station 13 is a global effort. Codebases and communities frequently port features and improvements from one another. It would be unfair to benefit from English-language codebases without making our work similarly accessible.

---

### Development direction
The direction of development is to keep the code stable since the fork.  
This means that the project places a **high priority** on:
- internal code changes (refactorings, bug fixes)
- minor changes in gameplay (QoL changes, changes that do not strongly affect the current gameplay balance)
- decorative changes (minor rearrangements on maps, addition of decorative items)
- Small additions (unique interaction mechanics for items, detailing mechanics of existing items)

And puts **lower priority**:
- global changes (new maps, major mechanic updates, new gamemodes)
- global visual changes (updates to graphical interfaces, game object sprites, other visual systems)
- game balance changes (changes to combat systems, medicine, item distribution, race specifics)
- porting entire systems from other projects (transferring mechanics, updating internal systems and replacing mechanics with modernized versions from other SS13 builds).

It is also important to note one of the priority development principles - following the [KISS (Keep it simple, spessman)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).  
SS13 is an extremely large-scale project that is very difficult to maintain even for experienced developers. Simplicity of implementation and documenting during the development allow to keep working despite thousands of files and tens of thousands of lines of code.
