# Disabling saves you the compilation time on startup, so if you're building the .dmb yourself (with VSCode build tasks for example), feel free to disable.

# NOTE(rufus): This configures a workaround for BYOND compatibility with Docker's `9p` and `grpcfuse` filesystems, which are used when mounting Windows host file systems into Linux containers. BYOND can't to access files on these filesystems but operates normally with `ext4` and `tmpfs`. To address this, files will be copied, and a background rsync loop will sync changes like logs or player data back to the host OS for persistence.
# IMPORTANT: Set to true when using Docker Desktop on Windows to launch containers. Since this might affect performance, avoid using Windows+Linux Docker Containers. Instead, host directly from Windows or use Linux+Linux Docker containers which will mount the folders without problematic filesystems.
# TL;DR Using Windows? Set to true. Otherwise set to false.
