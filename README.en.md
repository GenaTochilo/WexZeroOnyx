# ZeroOnyx
ZeroOnyx is a [Space Station 13](https://spacestation13.com/) server based on the [OnyxBay](https://github.com/ChaoticOnyx/OnyxBay) by the [Chaotic Onyx](https://github.com/ChaoticOnyx) team.

## Space Station 13
Space Station 13 is a highly interactive multiplayer online game, a space station simulator with complex systems and mechanics.  
It is also a role-playing game where each player acts as their character and according to their assigned profession.

Distinctive features of Space Station 13 include an extensive development history (over 20 years!) and open-source code, which allows teams and communities to adapt and expand gameplay to their liking.
This enables the development of unique game variants, some of which are not related to space or space stations at all.

ZeroOnyx is a relatively "classic" version of Space Station 13:
- Events unfold on a space station in the 26th century
- The main enemies of the corporation are still the Syndicate
- There are only two game maps, one of which is "Exodus", based on the historical "BoxStation".
- The main goal of the crew is to work according to assigned professions and maintain the station's functionality

Most of the information and manuals from the original project team are still relevant, but in the process of being revised or updated.
